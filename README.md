_Tasks:_ (not necessarily in the given order!)
- Complete the `fill()` function in [bucket_fill.py](bucket_fill.py)
- Write test cases to make sure that the function works correctly
- Describe your algorithm in a readme.pdf file and submit this separately to CATe (there is no need to commit this file to the repo)

You are encouraged to read the **DocStrings** present in the document.

To test your code you can use the following command:
```shell
python bucket_fill.py
```

Example pattern files are available in [data/](data/).
